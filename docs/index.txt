Introduction
------------

If you are developer, see the `Developer Documentation
<developer.html>`_; this will tell you how to add commands and
templates to ``paster``.

``paster serve``
----------------

The one useful command you may want to know about for ``paster`` is
``paste serve``.  This serves an application described in a `Paste
Deploy <http://pythonpaste.org/deploy>`_ configuration file.

Configuration
-------------

A quickstart (and example), if not complete explanation::

    [app:main]
    use = egg:PasteEnabledPackage
    option1 = foo
    option2 = bar

    [server:main]
    use = egg:PasteScript#wsgiutils
    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 80

``egg:PasteEnabledPackage`` refers to some package that has been
prepared for use with paste.deploy, and options given to that
package.  If you are starting out with some framework, you'll have to
reference some documentation for that framework to paste-deploy-ify
your application (or read the paste.deploy documentation).

In the same file is a server description.
``egg:PasteScript#wsgiutils`` is a server (named ``wsgiutils``)
provided by this package, based on `WSGIUtils
<http://www.owlfish.com/software/wsgiutils/>`_.  And we pass various
options particular to that server.

Other packages can provide servers, but currently Paste Script
includes glue for these:

``wsgiutils``:

    A `SimpleHTTPServer
    <http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-SimpleHTTPServer.html>`_
    based threaded HTTP server, using `WSGIUtils
    <http://www.owlfish.com/software/wsgiutils/>`_.

``flup_(scgi|fcgi|ajp)_(thread|fork)``:

    This set of servers supports `SCGI
    <http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/scgi/>`_, `FastCGI
    <http://www.fastcgi.com/>`_ and `AJP
    <http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/connectors-doc/common/ajpv13a.html>`_
    protocols, for connection an external web server (like Apache) to
    your application.  Both threaded and forking versions are
    available.  This is based on `flup
    <http://www.saddi.com/software/flup/>`_.

There is the start of support for `twisted.web2
<http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/web2/>`_ in
``paste.script.twisted_web2_server``; patches welcome.

Running the Server
------------------

``paster serve --help`` gives useful output::

  usage: /usr/local/bin/paster serve [options] CONFIG_FILE
  Serve the described application

  options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbose
    -q, --quiet
    -n NAME, --app-name=NAME
			  Load the named application (default main)
    -s SERVER_TYPE, --server=SERVER_TYPE
			  Use the named server.
    --server-name=SECTION_NAME
			  Use the named server as defined in the configuration
			  file (default: main)
    --daemon              Run in daemon (background) mode
    --pid-file=FILENAME   Save PID to file (default to paster.pid if running in
			  daemon mode)
    --log-file=LOG_FILE   Save output to the given log file (redirects stdout)
    --reload              Use auto-restart file monitor
    --reload-interval=RELOAD_INTERVAL
			  Seconds between checking files (low number can cause
			  significant CPU usage)
    --user=USERNAME       Set the user (usually only possible when run as root)
    --group=GROUP         Set the group (usually only possible when run as root)
    --stop-daemon         Stop a daemonized server (given a PID file, or default
			  paster.pid file)

Basically you give it a configuration file.  If you don't do anything
else, it'll serve the ``[app:main]`` application with the
``[server:main]`` server.  You can pass in ``--server-name=foo`` to
serve the ``[server:foo]`` section (or even
``--server-name=config:foo.ini`` to use a separate configuration
file).

Similarly you can use ``--app-name=foo`` to serve ``[app:foo]``.

``--daemon`` will run the server in the backgroup, ``--user`` and
``--group`` will set the user, as you might want to do from a start
script (run as root).  If you don't give a ``--pid-file`` it will
write the pid to ``paster.pid`` (in the current directory).

``--stop-daemon`` will stop the daemon in ``paster.pid`` or whatever
``--pid-file`` you give.  ``--log-file`` will redirect stdout and
stderr to that file.

``--reload`` will start the reload monitor, and restart the server
whenever a file is edited.  This can be a little expensive, but is
very useful during development.
